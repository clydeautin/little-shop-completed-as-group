## Background and Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices. 

We worked through all 36 user stories and deployed our app to heroku. Potential refactoring would involve more CSS styling, and some potential code clean-up.

## Learning Goals
- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- [Optional] Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code

## Requirements
- Must use Rails 7.1.x, Ruby 3.2.2
- Must use PostgreSQL
- All code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- Must use GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub PR comments, and either GitHub Projects or a project management tool of your group's choice (Trello, Notion, etc.)
- Must include a thorough README to describe the project
   - README should include a basic description of the project, a summary of the work completed, and some ideas for a potential contributor to work on/refactor next. Also include the names and GitHub links of all student contributors on your project. 
- Must deploy completed code to the internet (using Heroku or Render)
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment is not allowed
- Use of scaffolding is not allowed
- Any gems added to the project must be approved by an instructor
  - Pre-approved gems are `capybara, pry, faker, factory_bot_rails, orderly, simplecov, shoulda-matchers, launchy`
